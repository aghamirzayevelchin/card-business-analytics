# Case Study: Card Issuing (Emission) Analytics

## 1) Goal
Create a repeatable analytics pack for a bank card business to:
- track revenue/cost/profit by product,
- monitor turnover trends and channel mix,
- identify optimization opportunities,
- control and optimize scheme invoices.

## 2) KPI Definitions
- **Turnover (AZN):** total card transaction amount.
- **Transactions:** count of transactions.
- **Revenue:** interchange + card fees + FX markup.
- **Cost:** processing + scheme fees + fraud loss + issuance cost.
- **Profit:** revenue − cost.
- **Profit Margin:** profit / revenue.

## 3) Insights framework (what to say in interview)
- Which product has best margin? Why (fees, interchange, cost drivers)?
- Which channels drive turnover growth (POS vs E-com)?
- Are foreign transactions growing (FX opportunity)?
- Any MCC categories to target with campaigns/partners?
- Which invoice fee types are biggest and where to negotiate/optimize?
- Monitor disputes and recurring fee spikes.

## 4) Optimization ideas (examples)
- Reduce processing costs via routing/optimization by channel.
- Improve premium card fee monetization (bundles, benefits).
- Manage fraud losses with risk rules by MCC/channel.
- Invoice governance: reconcile invoice lines, flag anomalies, dispute incorrectly charged fees.
