# Key Insights & Optimization Ideas

## Findings
1) Product profitability differs mainly due to interchange rate and cost drivers (processing + scheme fees).
2) Turnover growth should be monitored by channel; E-commerce growth can improve revenue but may increase fraud costs.
3) Foreign turnover share is a monetization opportunity via FX markup and targeted cross-border campaigns.
4) High-turnover MCC groups are strong candidates for partnerships, cashback and merchant deals.
5) Scheme invoices require governance: recurring fee lines, disputes tracking, and spike detection.
6) Profit margin can be improved by reducing processing/scheme costs and optimizing premium fee strategy.

## Recommendations
- Build monthly “P&L + Turnover + Invoice” pack for management and payment schemes.
- Add anomaly alerts for invoice spikes and unusual chargeback increases.
- Target top MCC groups with campaigns to shift volume to higher-margin categories/channels.
